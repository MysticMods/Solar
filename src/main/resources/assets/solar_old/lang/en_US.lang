# Book

guide.me.info1=I found this empty book when I was repairing the altar. It looks old but sturdy enough to use. I decide to document my story, my findings and my experiences through this magical journey.

guide.me.info2=My father was an amazing man. An explorer just like my granddad. He used to tell my father amazing stories about ancient civilizations and my father passed those stories on to me. They sounded so magical.. Ancient tribes using powers beyond recognition. My father became an explorer, he discovered some pretty amazing things but was never satisfied.. He started searching for miracles in the stories that grandpa used to tell him. He was always away searching for those new found lands.

guide.me.info2.2=For these magical structures but never seemed to find anything of the sort. I was amazed by his determination, but it drove him mad. He changed a little bit every time he returned home. I hated seeing him like this.

guide.me.info3=But… I did believe him. I also believed in the stories passed down from generation to generation. Now that I am old enough to follow in my father’s footsteps I decided to just do go myself. Roam through lands, see the world, and I am glad I did. Now that I’ve found the first clue … it seems the stories might actually be real. This is going to be an exciting adventure.

guide.solar.info=The stories told about magical altars that could syphon energy out of the atmosphere. It was told the Ancients used this energy to their advantage, creating magical beings and using the energy to shape the world around them. It seems I have stumbled upon one of these altars and was able to repair it. If I hadn’t it would have probably crumbled to dust any time soon. The pillars around the altar look like menhirs that have corroded over the thousands, maybe even millions of years, but they did somehow survive. While writing this journal I can navigate through chapters by using the bookmarks left of the book. Then I can open one of the desired topics. If a topic uses more pages there is an arrow at the bottom for me to use.

guide.celestial_altar.info=Now that I have repaired one of the altars it is collecting a kind of energy. I can see different kinds of energy flows depending on day and night. This seems to be left out of the stories. I’ll call them Solar and Lunar energy. I still need to learn more, but I think I can start looking for more clues as to how to use the altar. I saw a broken trinket laying on the ground, but as I wanted to pick it up it turned to dust.. Maybe there is a way to replicate it.

guide.celestial_altar.ancients=The stories told me that the altar was their center point of the magic. It was the construction that could create their magic and unleash it upon the world. Closer investigations tell me that it’s the energy that is this magical power. The altar seems to collect it, and then radiate it out. But I am sure it does more than that.

guide.celestial_altar.ancients_2=I began experimenting with the altar, using different items on it, try to fit things into the slot at the top but it didn’t do anything. It just radiates energy.. Solar at day and Lunar at night. I got a little frustrated and threw a lot of items at the altar in anger. When suddenly a piece of stone started floating above it. I was amazed! It stopped its movement and in my surprise I saw it turned dark. It looks like it used the energy to burn the stone.. Sunburnt Stone.. I wonder if more items have this effect. What about the metals?

guide.ritual_amulet.info=From the glimpse I could get on the trinket, it looked somewhat like an amulet. It had distinct gold and silver parts on it, more gold than silver.. How did they get so much of a valued material. Maybe it’s plentiful in this world? By forging the gold surrounding the silver I should be able to recreate it. Then adding some string should make it an amulet. I’ve got some on me anyway. I wonder how the amulet will react when I interact with the amulet.

guide.menhir.info=When I found the altar the menhirs were very worn down. They didn’t seem to be standing in the right position either. Marks on the ground tell me they were placed more symmetrical, like a circle around the altar. 4 pillars were aligned to the sides of the altar with 3 blocks in between the menhir and the altar. 4 other pillars seemed to be diagonal of the altar, with 2 blocks in between.

guide.menhir.creation=Recreating these menhirs was not an easy task. I had to figure out what stone to use. It came down on sunburnt stone.. Although the menhirs around the altar looked like normal stone. The menhirs are 3 blocks tall, so you need 3 sunburnt stone per menhir. When placing my amulet in the altar it seems to automatically carve the stone blocks into their menhir form.

guide.runes.info=Now that I have sunburnt stone I can carve them into blank runes. These runes fit the slot on top of the altar perfectly. When I place such a blank rune into the slot the altar seems to seep energy out of the top but not that much. Everytime it does this, the rune seems to break bit by bit. I am sure this has more meaning.


guide.runes.unlocked_infusing=After doing more tests I am sure these runes are used as a storage or container for the energy that exists. I need a way to infuse the energy into the runes before I can use them on the altar.

guide.rune_infuser.info1=Now that I know what to do with these runes there is only the problem of how. The stories told that everything in this world is made out of this energy, like it is out of atoms. Maybe there is a way to extract this energy out of the item and trap it into this rune. It will be highly unstable and I am sure to lose the items but it could very well work. Let’s call those items reagents.

guide.rune_infuser.info2=I created construction using 2 foci that should that extract energy out of the reagent into the rune while stabilizing it at the same time. If I do not stabilize the reagent  it will probably explode or even worse. This does mean I won’t be able to retrieve it. If I want to get rid of one I should right click it with my amulet to release it. The infuser draws energy out of the altar to aid in this process. This means it needs to be placed closed to one to work.

guide.rune_infuser.info3=All I have to do now is find these reagents. I have noticed that whenever I walk across some chests with a blank rune I can hear items rumble. When I opened the chest certain items would be drawn towards the rune. I think this is because they may be one of the reagents. I can test more by throwing these items on the ground with a little distance.

guide.rune_infuser.info4=Whenever I try these reagents it seems that some of them won’t work. Depending on the energy signature in this world reagents will act differently. I wonder if the reagents that will not work with the infuser might be used for another purpose. It also seems only 1 reagent works per energy type.

guide.rune_infuser.crafting_info=I can create 2 types of foci that should be able to accept radiating energy from the Celestial Altar. One using gold and the other using silver.

guide.moon_flower.info=I saw some interesting flowers grow in the biomes with the most view of the sky. They looked very weak at daytime but stronger at nighttime. I think they might be night flowers so I should probably not try to collect them during daytime. Night time looks like a better chance to gather some.

guide.fiery_flower.info=These flowers only seem to spawn in desert. When trying to harvest them they sometimes seem to drop some blaze powder. I wonder if they are more common in the nether, or atleast drop more blaze powder.

guide.sundial.info=I really needed a better way of telling the current time. This clock is not as accurate as I want it to be so I have to find something different. I have seen people in my town using sundials. If I use the clock while creating one I should definitely be able to create a precise sundial to be able to tell the time.

guide.sunburnt.info=Sunburnt stone is stone that has been infused with the primal energy types. This stone is much harder and has a darker color. With the basic sunburnt I can create, I can create even more types of sunburnt stone. Give them some carvings or embellishments of different metal/gem types. This block will most certainly be used a lot.
Ancients used this block as their foundation of everything. Their civilization took a huge leap towards a better future when they discovered this type of stone.

guide.sunburnt_chest.info=The way ancients created sunburnt stone seems a bit too slow. I tried to create something that would allow for sunburnt stone to be made in bulk. I created a box, that looks more like a chest, that can amplifies the energy signature of the Solar type. This will seep into the stone turning it into sunburnt stone. This way I don’t have to use the altar to create more of this stone.

guide.arcane_anchor.info=Some of the spells I tried casting didn’t have any effect at all.. Not when I wear the amulet around my neck or when I try to channel it myself. The energy still is in the amulet. Maybe I need a better and stronger way of channeling this energy. I am tinkering on a device that drains the energy out of the amulet and lets the energy seep into the surrounding environment created an area of affect. In this area the energy will fulfil its purpose the way I intend it to. I do however wonder if the ancients came up with a similar way. Maybe even a more powerful way?

# Book Rituals

guide.spells.info=Some rituals won’t only release its magic, but they create a power that can be channeled into my Ritual Amulet. These powers are not infinite and either seem to have a duration or they use the power accumulated in the amulet. The amulet description should tell me what spell I currently have. The amulet won’t show what spell I have if I use the spell or the energy is depleted. Some don’t use up all its energy at once but depending on the situation it can be used more than once. I have noticed that you can see how much is left, or rather, I need to speculate it. But I have gotten very good at it so I can expect to be precise.

It gets its power from the Altar and the amount of power depends on the ritual. I wonder if I will ever be able to increase the power I get from the rituals. Some spells acquire me to wear this amulet around my neck. If I want to make a spell, I should put in the amulet before the rune so the energy flows into the amulet.

guide.rituals.info_1=The ancients used the altar to harness the energy and create their magic. The way they did this was through what they call “rituals”. These rituals will collect the energy, mold it and send it to its designated target. Right now I have discovered that its the air and an amulet.. I have not yet found any other container for the molded energy.

guide.rituals.info_2.1=Rituals look very hard to perform but are actually quite easy. In idle mode the altar doesn’t do much other than occasionally radiate a bit of the energy it seems to collect. To start a ritual you need to let the altar know it needs to start molding energy.

guide.rituals.info_2.2=I found out this is done by the runes in the slot on top of the altar. Once you place a rune, the altar will start sending energy out of its topside. The affinity of the energy depends on the time of day. Solar energy at day and Lunar at night. However if I only need Solar energy I do need to create a Solar Rune. Whenever I place a rune into the slot on the altar and the energy shoots through the rune, it will break it. The rune will crumble and the molded energy will take on the affinity of the rune. If I place a fire rune the energy will get the fire affinity. It seems there are endless possibilities of the amount and affinities of energy I can release.

guide.rituals.info_3=The molded energy that is released will go to its target. This is either the atmosphere around the altar or into the amulet. With the right combination of energy(amount and affinities) the energy might react with each other and create a spell or it will react with the environment around it. To finish a ritual all I have to do is shift + right click the altar. I will need to time is precisely before the altar releases another molded energy and ruins the energy composition needed for the ritual. Only with the right amount of energy a ritual will be successful.

guide.rituals.info_4=Rituals can have two outputs as far as I know while writing this. An immediate effect and a spell. Spells are created by placing a Ritual Amulet before inserting the first rune so the molded energy will use the Ritual Amulet as its target and it’ll be stored in there until used. If the amulet does not hold the right energy composition for a spell the energy will simply be released. Just like when the energy composition in the environment is not good the energy will simply disperse and it will not have any effect.

guide.rituals.info_5=I may not have any knowledge of rituals and what energy I need to perform them.. I saw these strange looking black ancient menhirs scattered over the terrain with these drawings on them. After doing my research on rituals it might be that those drawings are plans for rituals! I should go check some out and copy the writings on the pillars. I do this by right clicking the Journal on the Ancient Menhir.

guide.ritual_clear_skies.info=Some ancient tribes lived in very wet places. So wet that land would drown in water, plants would die and wildlife would migrate to other places depending on the seasons. Creating a ritual that would stop the rain and make a more suitable environment seemed better than adapting to it, and thus the Rite of Clear Skies came to be. I too am not a fan of the rain...

guide.ritual_rain.info=Like some tribes lived in wetlands, others lived in deserts and other dry lands. Having found out about agriculture via travelers and stories they wanted to try out the same things. But their climate was not suited well enough for growing any more plants than the current living desert plants. Creating the Rite of Rain would fix that in an instant.

guide.ritual_high_tide.info=In times of drought in normally wet places the tribes started working on a ritual that would allow energy to take on the form of water. But this could only be done if there was water close to place of activation. If used on water bodies it will add energy to those bodies which makes them grow in height. This however should not be a large water body. If it is too large the energy becomes unstable and it will try to escape back into the energy flow.

guide.ritual_summer_heat.info=This ritual is a counterpart of the Rite of High Tide. Ancients used this ritual after long periods of rain when they needed the land for planting new crops. Instead of leveling water up it will vaporize the top layer. Just like with the counterpart I should be careful with how big of an area I try to vaporize.

guide.ritual_rising_moon.info=This powerful ritual is of particular interest to me. This ritual uses time energy which can be very unstable if not handled correctly. Because lunar energy only exists at night and can only be used at night, most of the ancient tribes gathered together and started working on a ritual that would allow them to speed up time itself. This was very dangerous and many died in the process. It seems though I should be alright now that I have the knowledge of the ritual. This is one of the 2 time rituals, and it will speed up daytime.

guide.ritual_rising_sun.info=This ritual is the counterpart to the Rite of Rising Moon. Like lunar energy only exists at night, solar energy only exists at daytime. This ritual is used to speed up the time at night, making the sun rise faster. Just like the Rite of Rising Moon this is expensive to do, and should only be done when necessary.

guide.ritual_solar_protection.info=The world is a very dangerous place at night, without the protection of sun energy monsters start to spawn from a dark force. I found something that looks like an interesting ritual. With the use of sun energy I will be able to create a ritual that seeps out that same sun energy over time, copying the effects of daytime. I am basically replicating the effects of the sun.

guide.ritual_lunar_embrace.info=If I can replicate the effects of the sun with the Rite of Solar Protection I should be able to do the same with the moon. With the energy of the moon runes I can create  a ritual which will allow dangerous mobs to spawn at daytime. Undead won't burn and the area isn't safe to be around. But who knows what I can use this for.

guide.ritual_hunt.info=In desperate times when the Ancients couldn’t find enough wildlife to hunt for, they created a ritual that would solve that problem for them. This ritual infuses the power of sun and life together, with more wildlife appearing in the area of the ritual as result. There are even records of more ocelots appearing in jungle biomes.

guide.ritual_botanical_growth.info=Some ancient tribes their believes involved not eating any meat. Winter would be a hard time for them since most of the crops would not grow. To get rid of this problem they created a ritual that would speed up the plants grow stages by releasing life and sun energy in the atmosphere. It does seem that at night the ritual is half as effective than when it’s day.

guide.ritual_purification.info=The ancients used this ritual to create liquid forms of the solar and lunar energy. They mostly did this because soaking oneself in the liquid gives you enhanced effects for a short time. Which liquid is formed depends on the time of the day. I wonder what more uses they had for these liquids.

guide.ritual_levitation.info=I really wondered what happened if I would infuse wind energy in a different pattern than the Rite of Clear Skies. Apperently this creates an upward stream of wind! It's great for imobilizing other mobs. It will not work on me though, I guess the wind isn't powerfull enough.

guide.ritual_stabilized_earth.info=Sand and gravel falls down which can sometimes be an unwanted experience if you like to use it for something.. other than falling down or crafting. With this ritual I can turn sand and gravel blocks into stabilized gravel. The altar mixes the time and earth energy to create sand and gravel that won't fall down. The earth energy is needed so that the time energy can be infused into the blocks. Basically stopping their time! All I have to do is hold some sand or gravel in my inventory.

guide.ritual_melting_alloy.info=Using earth energy to let fire energy infuse into the blocks, and then cooling them down with water energy... if this succeeds then this ritual will be able to smelt my ores into ingots for me without having to use a furnace! I would assume this is quite an expensive process though. But it should work just fine if I wear my amulet around my neck.

guide.ritual_wind_ward.info=When the tribes were at war some of them began developing weapons that could shoot projectiles. Because they could keep their distance and still win wars they were almost becoming invincible. When one of the losing tribesman began to notice that when there is strong wind the arrows their trajectory would shift he started thinking.. what if I could create a strong wind around me that would deflect these arrows. And so came to be, the Rite of Wind Warding.

guide.ritual_flame_arrow.info=With this ritual hanging around my neck I will be able to shoot flammable arrows without needing the Flame enchantment. It uses the fire energy to light my arrows the moment I shoot them.

guide.ritual_anguish_sorrow.info=This ritual can give help in times of anguish and sorrow. Upon dying to your enemy and wearing the amulet powered by this ritual it will release a ritual that sends life energy back into your body. This can only be done once per ritual.

guide.ritual_heat.info=While wearing this ritual around my neck I become resistant to any heat. It seems the damage fire and immense heat would do to my body is first absorbed by my amulet.

# Artifacts

guide.artifacts.info=In some stories people would speak of immense strong beings called the chosen ones. These beings were favored by the gods and were given strange artifacts. These artifacts are as close as one can get to retrieving the power of the gods. Right now it is known that there exist 10 artifacts in the world. But nobody has ever found them. Is it because the gods recall the artifacts ones a chosen one has died? I hope I will be able to figure it out.

guide.artifacts.notice=Artifacts are currently only obtainable in creative

guide.ring_flight.info=This is one of the 10 artifacts that have the shape of a ring. When equipping this ring it will allow me to fly!

guide.ring_undead.info=This is one of the 10 artifacts that have the shape of a ring. When I have this ring equipped it negates all damage of undead monsters attacking me. That doesn't however mean I am untouchable. They still pack quite a punch.
